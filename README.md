Project: Dual Network Effects in the EV Transition: Rise of Charging, Decline of Gas.

This script implements a trim-level matching algorithm used to link messy price data with sales registration records.

It includes: 
1) Trim similarity scoring (Sørensen–Dice);
2) Year penalty adjustment;
3) Multi-step fallback matching

The function is used in for matching the prive for vehicles for subsequent modeling.

### Stata Sample

File: coding_sample.do

Project: Does the Low-Carbon City Pilot Policy Promote Technology Innovation?

This do-file contains the full workflow used in the project: 
1) Data import and cleaning
2) Variable construction
3) DID estimation with fixed effects
4) Robustness and placebo tests
5) Event-study analysis
6) Automated result export and visualization

The file demonstrates an end-to-end applied econometrics pipeline in Stata.
